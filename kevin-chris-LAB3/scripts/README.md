**Author**: Chris Hemenes Kevin Hwangpo
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

We're creating this blog to provide information to the user on various topics. As a developer were learining to create a fluid interactive experience that can provide detailed information in a clear view.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Create a script to link a view to the article. Learn to create functions the will give the user options in which catagorey/author they'd like to view. Use easy to read Jquery methods to create acess the DOM. Be sure to call functions at the end of code and test.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
We used Jquery for shorter methods, Normalize.CSS for default settings. Used multiple scripts to stack the js files in use from greatest to lowest. (article.js was the most manipulated)

## Change Log
<!-- Use this are to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with GET and POST routes for the book resource.
